							<h2>A multifaceted figure</h2>
							<p align="justify">A lot has been said about the empress Elizabeth of Austria and everyone remembers her for her endearing yet infamous nickname. Sissi has been the protagonist of many books, movies and cartoons, usually portrayed as the <b>stereotypical</b> beautiful princess out of a fairy tale. We choose her because we wanted to build a heterogeneous narration of this character, trying to understand her in a large ranging prospective. In fact, she is still to this day a very mysterious figure and, contrary to the popular belief, she has been addressed many times as a <a href="https://books.google.it/books/about/The_Reluctant_Empress.html?id=WLFnAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y">“reluctant princess”</a>.  Such as many other women in the same historical role, she always questioned the conventions of dynasty and court, giving priority to her personal interests. Elisabeth’s marriage with Fraz Joseph I led her to become <b>Queen of Hungary</b>, and over time she developed a deep affection for this country and its culture, frequently visiting Hungary as she truly enjoyed its more relaxed atmosphere and the beloved Hungarians. More importantly, she played a crucial role in the history of Europe, helping the realization of the <b>Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867</b>, by advocating for Hungary and the rights of its people. </p>

							<h2>The European spirit</h2>
							<p align="justify">Understandably, as Sissi did not enjoy the constraints of her royal life, she also refused to live in the places that were traditionally intended for her role. She always preferred staying in other residences, that she felt to be more personal, safe and private than the crowded realities of cities like Vienna. Her favorite residence was the one in <b><i>Gödöllő</i></b>, that was gifted to her and Franz Joseph I after their Hungarian coronation. She also dedicated a huge part of her life to travels, both for reasons related to her poor health conditions and her desire to find an escape from the court.Sissi traveled through Europe, <b>Bavaria</b>, <b>Austria</b> and <b>Hungary</b>, but also visited <b>Greece</b>, the Adriatic coast in <b>Italy</b> and <b>Switzerland</b>, where she died in September 1898. Nowadays, it is possible to follow her footsteps alongside the so-called <b><i>Sissi’s Street</i></b>, a European cultural itinerary that, in addition to the many royal residences that are visited annually by citizens and tourists, accompanies the discovery of the most important places of the empress of Austria’s life, through 2,000 kilometers and across multiple countries. </p><ul class="actions stacked">

							<h2>Her legacy</h2>
							<p align="center">Sissi’s legacy has lived on in books, films, and through memorials to her all throughout Austria. She is often remembered for her incredible beauty, <b>style</b> and strong attitude. In 1955 the first of three <b>movies</b> called Sissi was released, starring <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romy_Schneider"><b>Romy Schneider</b></a> as Sissi. These movies saw an instant recognition and success, and are today still beloved in Austria and all throughout the world. Those movies also made Romy Schneider an instant star and renewed the already established popularity of Sissi's <b>aesthetic heritage</b>. In 2014, the annual Chanel Métiers d’Art collection was showcased in Salzburg. Designer Karl Lagerfeld made a <a href="https://fashionmagazine.com/style/chanel-cara-delevingne-pharrell-williams/">short film</a> featuring Cara Delevigne and Pharrell Williams as the imperial couple. Cara was wearing Sissi’s infamous white gown with stars in her hair and Pharrell was dressed as the emperor. Today, her name is often <b>synonymous</b> for glamour and designers will mention her whenever they want to evoke opulence.</p>
