							<h2>Theoretical Model</h2>
							<p align="justify">A theoretical model is a symbolic representation that helps us to express <b>abstract</b> concepts and relationships easily, using minimal words from <b>natural language</b>. It provides a point of focus for attacking the unknown in a specific area and it establishes the vision to which the project is directed, restricting the attention on specific points of interest. Given the relationships found between two or more variables in the previous E/R framework, this model reveals the <b>theory</b> behind the existence of the relationship itself and the nature of the entities, answering to the questions <b>who? where? when?</b> and <b>what?</b></p>

			<!-- Who -->
				<section class="wrapper style1 align-left">
					<div class="index inner">
					<h2 align-center>Who?</h2>
					<div class="content">
						<p align="justify">The perspective embraced to describe <b>people</b> in our model is based on thinking that a person can assume different degrees of relationship with an entity. Observing our models, we noted that we needed to find a way for describing both people whose role was exclusively related to the <b>production/ownership</b> value of an item, and also people of <b>historical relevance</b>, especially those coming from a well-established <b>royal families</b>, who are considered central <b>agents</b> in events and have more complex relationships with places, concepts and other historical figures. For this reason, we will describe them by using a mix of different ontologies and vocabulary like <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/">FOAF</a>, <a href="https://wiki.dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/person">Person Core Vocabulary</a>, <a href="https://d-nb.info/standards/elementset/gnd">GND Ontology</a> and <a href="https://eac.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/">EAC-CPF</a>.</p>
						</div>
			<!-- Where -->
					<h2 align-center>Where?</h2>
					<div class="content">
						<p align="justify">Identifying <b>locations</b> is a very important part of our project, because it allows us to understand the intricated web of political and historical relationships that characterized Sissi’s life. As anticipated in the <a href="whysissi.html">Why Sissi?</a> section, travels played a big role in her increasing European popularity and they are also the reason why our items come from so many different <b>countries</b>. We decided to make use of different ontologies in order to be able to cover all the potential specifications of places, paying special attention to the description of castles and <b>royal palaces</b>. <a href="http://www.geonames.org/ontology/documentation.html">GeoNames Ontology</a> and <a href="http://www.georss.org/w3c.html">Basic Geo Vocabulary</a> seemed the best to use for our scenario. <a href="https://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html">Schema.org</a>, <a href="http://www.cidoc-crm.org/">CIDOC-CRM</a> and <a href="https://wiki.dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a> were also used.</p>
						</div>
			<!-- When? -->
					<h2 align-center>When?</h2>
					<div class="content">
						<p align="justify">Taken into consideration the fact that the focus of our project is a person, we initially thought at the notion of time as a <b>uniform time span</b>, limited by the date of her birth and the day of her death. Soon, we realized that our project doesn’t just focus on what Sissi did during her lifetime, but also on what she has left. Her <b>legacy</b> is just as important as her personal actions. So, it was important to <b>not set limits</b> to our domain by including in out model any <b>date-entity</b>, which would appear to be too arbitrary in such an extensible environment. However, dates, encoded in the format <b>YYYY-MM-DD</b>, and years, in <b>YYYY</b>, will be used to enrich the description of all the other entities, as set by the ISO 8601. To include this information in the RDF file we used <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#http://purl.org/dc/terms/date">Dublin Core</a>, which can be used to express temporal information at any level of granularity.
						</p>
						</div>
			<!-- What? -->
					<h2 align-center>What?</h2>
					<div class="content">
						<p align="justify">The description of subjects in the case of the SissiLinked project must be considered related to the notion of <b>event</b> and <b>abstract concept</b>. In particular, we needed to find a way for describing events that were relevant both <b>biographically</b>, and therefore inherently adopting the notion of person as an agent, and <b>historically</b>, in order to show the interconnection and the outcome of personal experiences on history itself. On the other hand, some items can be also seen as the physical expression, embodiment or documentation of an <b>artistic style</b>. The notion of style, intended as an abstract concept not already institutionalized, must take in consideration the heterogeneous facets of the arts, from the more traditional musical expressions to the diverse domains of fashion. For these reasons we will use different ontologies and vocabularies, such as <a href="https://vocab.org/bio/">BIO Vocabulary</a>, <a href="http://motools.sourceforge.net/event/event.html">Event Ontology</a>, <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/">FOAF</a>, <a href="http://www.cidoc-crm.org/sites/default/files/2018-05-16%23CIDOC%20CRM_v6.2.3_esIP%28XDP%29%28XM%29.pdf">CIDOC-CRM</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a>, <a href="http://musicontology.com/">Music Ontology</a>, <a href="https://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/2012-06-14/?v=elements">Dublin Core</a> and <a href="https://wiki.dbpedia.org/services-resources/ontology">DBpedia</a>.

											<h2>Theoretical Graphs</h2>
													<p>This model reveals the theoretical nature of each entity - as specified in the paragraphs shown above, but in a graphical way - by making explicit whether it is a <b>person</b>, an <b>event</b>, an <b>item</b>, a <b>concept</b> or a <b>place</b>. Due to a first process of abstraction, entities and relationships that were considered not functional for the overall representation of the domain have been summarized and transformed into attributes, called <i>Metadata</i>. </p>
